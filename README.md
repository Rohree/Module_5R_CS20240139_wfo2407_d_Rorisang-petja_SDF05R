## Project Outline:

- Design engaging button animations with CSS.
- Master the use of CSS transitions and animations for interactive effects.

## My Design Choices

I envisioned buttons for three different websites/App:

- btn1 - A consulting website that has a "Book here" CTA button
- btn2 - With a breathing animation (use-case can be a mindfull app or a meditation app)
- btn3 - could be a for a phone app.


## Challenges that I faced doing this project:
- I used the project as an oportunity to learn animations and transitions in css design.
